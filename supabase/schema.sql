-- Row Level Security ---------------------------------------------------------
-- The app talks to Supabase with the anon key, which is public by design (it
-- ships in the browser bundle). RLS is therefore the actual access control:
-- anyone may read, anyone may submit a review, nobody may edit or delete.

-- Submissions are open (no accounts in the MVP). The column checks above are
-- the server-side guard on rating ranges and body length. `is_sample` is not
-- writable by the public policy path — seeded rows are inserted by an admin.
